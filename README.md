# Introduction

We cannot live without electricity. The way it is connected to our daily lives shows how indispensable it is to people. However, power consumption, including use of electricity, is corrupting our future. Burning down fossil fuels, which is the common way in producing energy, is proven to be a hazard on air, water, and all sorts of natural substances. Economic alliances and several countries, leaded by group of OECD countries, are asserting mandatory control on energy consumption regarding its future threats.

This brings us question of whether the significance of energy consumption is well accepted to nations. With this in mind we would like to find out world power consumption level and the growth rate to see whether nations are acknowledging the potential threat. Furthermore, we would like to analyze continents and economic alliances that well reduced energy consumption to rank the leading groups in accomplishing their duties and get some insights from these countries. This would be useful to those with the highest power consumption growth rate. At last verification of external factors that influence energy consumption will be proceeded.

# Research Question

How has world energy consumption changed (measured by the original value and growth rate)
What continent and economic alliances is leading the energy consumption reduction?
What is an external factor that has influenced the reduction of energy consumption

# Hypothesis

The energy consumption varies greatly among different geographical locations and economic alliances(BRICS, CIS, and OECD).
According to various situational variables (2008 financial crisis, COVID-19, etc.), consumption of energy will decrease temporarily.
G2 countries(United States and China) will account for a large proportion of energy consumption.

#Data Resources - Information, Definitions

The dataset outlines the quantity of terawatt (TWh) produced through various sets of energy, consists of both non-renewable energy and renewable energy.

Energy Consumption: All the energy used to perform an action, manufacture something or simply inhabit a building.

TWh: A unit of energy equal to outputting one trillion watts for one hour. This value is large enough to express annual electricity generation for entire countries, and is often used when describing major energy production or consumption.
